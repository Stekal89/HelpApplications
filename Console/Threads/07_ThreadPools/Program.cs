         Thread pools
            When working directly with the Thread class, you create a new thread each time, and the
            thread dies when you’re finished with it. The creation of a thread, however, is something that
            costs some time and resources.
            A thread pool is created to reuse those threads, similar to the way a database connection
            pooling works. Instead of letting a thread die, you send it back to the pool where it can be
            reused whenever a request comes in.
            When you work with a thread pool from .NET, you queue a work item that is then picked
            up by an available thread from the pool. Listing 1-7 shows how this is done.
