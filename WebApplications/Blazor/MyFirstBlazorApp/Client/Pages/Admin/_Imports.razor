    Specifying a layout explicitly for an individual page

    So far we’ve seen that a default layout can be specified in the /Pages/_Imports.razor file. We’ve also seen that this setting can be overridden by 
    Blazor finding a more specific _Imports.razor file closer to the page it is rendering. 
    The final (and most explicit) level of specifying a template to use is to literally specify it in the page itself using the @layout directive.
